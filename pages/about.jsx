            alGIRLithm is a student-led organization working to inspire the next
            generation of female computer scientists by making competitive
            programming accessible to high school girls. We aim to increase
            girlsâ€™ interest, confidence, and participation in computer science
            and competitive programming, fields that continue to experience
            female underrepresentation today, by providing opportunities, role
            models and a community.
